## Chacter
goliath fighter
## Appearance
He is a northerner, full of scars and armed with a two-handed sword. He is very tall, and his skin color is slightly odd. The face is completely calm with no emotions of any sort. This face suggests that you would rather be anywhere else but at the table with him arguing; it screams “danger”.
## First introduction (when party members connect the nickname/reputation with a person).
Soren Northridge, infamous as Soren the Red, is a feared warrior in the Spine of the World, an advisor to the local king and warlord Eldran. Soren’s infamous reputation was sealed when he earned his nickname at the "The Crimson Tankard" inn. A brutal carnage raged inside, leaving him as the lone survivor. He was the only one to leave the already burning building after the battle. No one knew what the reason or the goal was. Citizens who rushed to the inn to put down the fire saw a frightening picture. As Soren walked out, red drops were falling from his hair, wet from all the blood spilled inside. He had a chilling grin on his face as he left 23 dead bodies behind. 
## Biography
Soren was born in the North. His father was a human, and his mother was a goliath. Mother died several winters ago from an unknown disease, and the family of 3 worked on a small piece of land, living in relative isolation. His sister was a human from the father’s first marriage. 
Soren first met King Eldran when the king’s army raided his village. They were willing to seize food for the war effort. Business as usual for the local population. But one of the officers in the king’s ranks laid hands on Soren’s sister. Soren defended his sister, attacked the officer, and used everything at his disposal to beat a way more experienced fighter: an element of surprise, some trickery, sucker punches and a clever-made improvised weapon. He killed the officer in a brawl (which can be defined as a fair fight in the North). As a result, Soren was brought to the king to explain himself, or to be executed. Fallen officers’ soldiers described what he did, and the king decided that a man of his abilities and wits could be useful in his army, thus, he decided to enlist him as an infantryman in his ranks to pay his debt to the king for taking the officer’s life. Not much of a choice. 
After years of serving the king, Soren managed to become so lethal with his sword that no one could surpass him in his ability to kill. His lethal prowess was so deadly that the king started to summon Soren to battle in ritualistic duels, a fight to the death to decide a winning side in a battle between two armies. And Soren did not disappoint. He won more than a dozen duels. This earned him immense trust and respect from the king and his brethren. Intelligent and smart, brutal and astute, he doesn’t draw satisfaction from the killings. He is calculative, deadly, and cold-blooded. If there is a goal, Soren achieves it, disregarding anything on his path. And he had a goal - to rise through the ranks to power, to escape his former simple and dull life, and to find his father and sister. Soren reached his current position using his wits and his sword, and became the closest royal shield bearer, helping the king to rule with an iron fist. There is however a stain in this tapestry, as his comrades, despite trusting him and admiring him, also feared him. His killings and his efficiency with a sword strike horror into everyone who witnesses him at “work”. As a result, he never managed to find a real friend among the soldiers. The only person close to him in the whole world was King Eldran. And his quest to find his family led to nowhere, as he was unable to find them or track them, even using his power and status in the army. 
## How did Soren manage to become an exile, roaming far from Eldrath kingdom?
It was a betrayal. Envy and fear led King Eldran to conspire against Soren, as his troops started to almost worship Soren. He was the one betting on his life every time he stepped into the duel ring, saving his comrades from full-scale battles, not the King. And it was obvious to everyone that Soren’s advice kept the army afloat and functioning, as his tactical mind and wits were well suited for the job.  
The king decided to eliminate his best swordsman and advisor. However, Soren discovered the plot and attempted a counter-assassination. He decided to strike first and started by taking the best sword from the King’s armory. King gave this marvelous weapon to Soren before, so he could win duels for him. This piece of art has no match, and Soren knew it. He used it to cut through the king’s guards during the night. He rushed to the bed chamber, killing everyone inside, including striking the king's heir in his bed. But the king was not there. The only possible place left was a library tower. Soren charged to the tower, but he created too much chaos to be left unnoticed. He almost reached the king, but was stopped by a group of guards and couldn’t finish Eldran. He was pushed back and had no other option but to attempt an escape from the fortress. He was, however, eventually cornered. Facing certain death after his capture through indisputable torture, he decided to do anything not to be caught, but to be killed in a fight. At this moment, he heard a mysterious voice. The situation was desperate and hopeless, and Soren didn’t hesitate to agree to anything this voice said. Accepting the sinister bargain, he vanquished an additional dozen elite guards at the gate. Despite lethal wounds, he was able to run away. Those wounds would’ve killed any man, but he somehow managed to flee the castle and escape.
## What is Soren’s motivation to join the group/quest?
Plain and simple – revenge. Soren is in exile, haunted by mercenaries hired by his former brother and king. Soren pursues revenge and is searching for allies, comrades, resources and means to finish King Eldran. As Soren roams the realms in pursuit of vengeance, his journey leads him to the group of adventurers at this marvellous table. 
After some fights, Soren’s new friends and comrades noticed his strange behaviour that occurs in battles. His voice and intonation slightly change, and he is less calm and calculating than usual. His unnatural efficiency with a sword is sometimes replaced with fierce swings. And sometimes, as weird as it might sound, it seems that his eyes are glowing red. Party members ask him about this, and the last part of Soren’s story unfolds. 
The escape that defied all odds was staged. Dots are connected by the party members, as Soren was not able to fully analyze this incident. He never questioned how he managed to survive and not bleed to death from all the wounds he collected throughout his escape. The reason for that is the fact that he does not have complete memories or awareness of some battles, especially his escape from Eldrath’s castle. In addition to that, the voice never showed itself after the escape. As the plot advances, the truth is uncovered – Soren’s escape was facilitated by a pact with a demon, Azrakhan the Devourer. This mighty fiend occasionally pushes Soren to the limit during blood-thirsty battles, enhancing his already vicious skills for a purpose originally known only to Azrakhan, but uncovered by party members later - to collect souls.
There are many ways to look at this situation, but one thing is for certain - Azrakhan couldn’t have chosen a more suitable vessel and a “partner”.
